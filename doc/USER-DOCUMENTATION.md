# Features
HSTR is typically started by pressing <kbd>Ctrl-r</kbd> after
you configure it for this shorcut in your shell. However,
you can run it as a normal program just by typing:

```bash
hstr
```

... or use simpler command configured using [alias](../CONFIGURATION.md#alias):

```bash
hh
```

It opens a page with a history view (ranking view is default).
Alternatively you can run HSTR in non-interactive mode -
commands are just listed on standard output based on history
view:

```bash
hstr --non-interactive
```

Filtering pattern can be optionally specified as well:

```bash
hstr -i git
```

Prints history items containing `git` to standard output and
exits.

HSTR can also read text input from a pipe instead of shell
history, allowing you to interactively browse and filter
any text data:

```bash
ls | hstr
```

This opens HSTR with the output of `ls` command, which you
can filter and select from. Any command output can be piped
to HSTR this way.

## History Filtering
When HSTR starts in interative mode, a view of commands
is shown. This list of commands can be filtered just by typing
a string pattern.


## Choosing a Command
When you filtered the view of history items enough, you can
move around it with `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys. Selected history
items is highlighted. Once you are done with your choice:

* press `ENTER` to choose the command and execute it
* or press `TAB` or `RIGHT` arrow key to choose the command and edit it on command line after exiting HSTR
* or press `LEFT` arrow key to choose the command and open it in editor (`bash` `fc` i.e. fix command)


## Favorite Commands
HSTR allows you to store and manage your favorite
commands.

A new favorite command can be added from
ranking or raw history view by pressing <kbd>Ctrl-f</kbd>.

You can check your favorite commands by choosing
favorite view - rotate views using <kbd>Ctrl-/</kbd> or start
HSTR by adding `favorites-view` to `HSTR_CONFIG` environment
property. A favorite command can be choosen just
by pressing `ENTER` when on command in favorite view.
Last chosen favorite commands appears as the first
one (at the top of the page) in the favorite view.
You can delete a favorite command with `DEL` key.

Tips:

* Favorite commands are stored in `~/.hstr_favorites`
* Suffix your favorite commands with comments
  describing their purpose. For example:

```
printf "\e[?2004l"   # fix terminal copy/paste
```

* Such comment can be used for normal commands
  as well and may serve as a way how to **tag**
  commands.

```bash
COMMAND # TAG1 TAG2 TAG3
...
printf "\e[?2004l" # fix broken copy/paste in terminal #TERM
```
## Blacklist
HSTR allows you to specify a set of commands to be
skipped from all the views. Blacklist typically contains
frequently used commands whose completion from history
has a little or no value. The default blacklist looks
like this:

```bash
pwd
cd
cd ..
ls
hstr
mc
```

Tips:

* Blacklist of commands is stored in `~/.hstr_blacklist`
  If the file doesn't exist, you may create it and complete
  it with your own blacklist.
* You can skip any command from history just by
  prefixing it with `SPACE`. For example:
  ` echo "Skip this from history"` It's a `bash`
  option that is configured using
  `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace` environment variable.


## Kill the Last Command
Using HSTR you can easily delete the last command from history
e.g. when you make a typo or write something sensitive:

```
hstr --kill-last-command
```

See configuration section for how to bind this functionality to
a key - bound to <kbd>Ctrl-k</kbd> by default.


# Examples
Get more colors when running HSTR:

```bash
export HSTR_CONFIG=hicolor
```

Start HSTR in configured view and filter out history items
containing 'git' (make sure `hh` is defined using
[alias](../CONFIGURATION.md#alias)):

```bash
hh git
```

Print history items containing 'git' to standard output and exit:

```bash
hh --non-interactive git
```

Append  default `hh` configuration to your `bash` profile:

```bash
hh --show-configuration >> ~/.bashrc
```

Check HSTR man page:

```bash
man hstr
```

Browse output of any command interactively:

```bash
ls -la | hh
```
